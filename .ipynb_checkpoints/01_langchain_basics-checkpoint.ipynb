It was founded on 1 November 1993, when the Treaty of Maastricht came into force, though its origins can be traced back to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), which were established in the 1950s. \\n\\nThe EU has evolved over time and its activities and influence have expanded beyond its original focus on coal and steel production and trade. It is now a significant political entity with its own legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. \\n\\nThe EU has had a profound impact on the countries within it, helping to promote economic growth, cooperation, and peace among its members. It has also been a major player on the world stage, promoting its values and interests in international affairs. ')], [Generation(text=\" The area of a typical room is calculated by multiplying the length by the width, assuming both length and width are perpendicular to each other. This is known as the geometric formula for area, A = L x W. \\n\\nFor rooms that are irregularly shaped, break the room into smaller sections that are rectangular or square, calculate the area of each section, and then add them together to get the total area. \\n\\nAnother tip is to take your measurements to the nearest tenth of a foot, or millimeter if you're working with a metric tape measure. This will give you a more accurate area calculation, especially if you're trying to determine whether a certain furniture item will fit in the room or if you're designing a floorplan with exact dimensions. \\n\\nIf you have irregular angles or curved edges, break these sections into smaller, regular geometric shapes like triangles, rectangles, or semi-circles. Calculate the area of each shape then add them together to get the total area. Consider the shape's features, such as whether it has 90-degree angles or rounded corners when selecting the appropriate units of measurement. \\n\\nA room with triangular sections, for instance, might require you to measure distances along arcs, in which case you'd use different units of measurement for length and for radius, like radians. When calculating the area for irregular rooms with varied features, you may need to employ different units of measurement for each shape, and then present the final calculation in a unified unit. \\n\\nFor complex layouts, you might want to draw a rough sketch of the room and mark the shapes you want to calculate or use a graphics editing program to precisely draw and measure each shape. Always use the same units of measurement for your calculations, whether it's square meters, square feet, acres, or a variety of other options. \\nThis will make it easier to compare and understand the results. In addition, there are some common area calculation mistakes to avoid. These include:\\n\\n- Measuring the wrong distances: It's easy to mix up the lengths of a room or the width and the corresponding angles. Always double-check your measurements.\\n- Using the wrong formula: There's a good chance that a basic rectangle isn't all you're dealing with if you're trying to calculate the area of an oddly shaped room. Use multiple rectangles, triangles, and other shapes to calculate more complex areas\\n- Not factoring in the ceiling height: For calculations involving vaulted or two-story ceilings, take the extra height into account\")]]\n"

      "The function takes a vector of numerical values as input and returns the same vector, with each element having been transformed according to the softmax function. This transformation ensures that the vector of outputs will sum up to 1, while being greater than or equal to 0. \n",

      "Here's the Python code that implements the softmax function:\n",

      "\n",
      "def softmax(vector):\n",
      "    normalized_vector = vector - np.max(vector)\n",

      "    return exponentiated / np.sum(exponentiated)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this code:\n",
      "-   `np.max(vector)` finds the maximum value in the input vector.\n",
      "-   `vector - np.max(vector)` subtracts the maximum value from each element of the vector, this ensures that the resultant values are centered around 0.\n",
      "-   `np.exp(normalized_vector)` exponentiates the normalized vector, this is the core of the softmax transformation.\n",
      "-   `np.sum(exponentiated)` adds up all the values in the exponentiated vector, this is used to normalize the values so they add up to 1.\n",
      "-   `exponentiated / np.sum(exponentiated)` divides the exponentiated vector by the sum, thereby returning the softmax transformed vector. \n",
      "\n",

      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThe provided Python function, named `softmax`, serves as an implementation of the softmax algorithm, a crucial component in certain neural networks and probabilistic computations. Softmax transforms an input vector in a way that the output values are adjusted to be non-negative and sum up to 1. This makes it useful for multiclass classification problems, where the output represents the probability distribution over different classes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a detailed breakdown of the function:\n",
      "1. **Input**: The function takes a single argument, `vector`, which is expected to be a numeric array or vector. This vector is likely to be the output of some neural network layer, representing the raw values for classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Normalization**: The first step in the softmax process is to ensure that the elements of the vector are centered around 0. This is achieved by subtracting the maximum value of the vector from each element. This normalization step helps prevent numerical instability issues when dealing with large values. The line `normalized_vector = vector - np.max(vector)` performs this operation using NumPy's array manipulation functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Exponentiation**: After normalizing the vector, the function applies exponentiation to each element. This step amplifies the differences between the values, pushing them further away from zero. The mathematical operation of exponentiation is carried out using NumPy's built-in function `np.exp(normalized_vector)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Normalization Trick**: To ensure that the output values sum up to 1, the function performs a normalization trick. It first computes the sum of the exponentiated values using `np.sum(exponentiated)`. Then, it divides each element of the exponentiated vector by this total sum. This division operation transforms the vector such that its values are now in the range of 0 to 1 and sum up to 1. This is achieved with the line `exponentiated / np.sum(exponentiated)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output**: The function returns the transformed vector, which represents the softmax of the input vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The softmax function has a variety of applications, including being a key component in multiclass classification problems. It can help predict the probability of different classes, making it a valuable tool in fields like natural language processing, image recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Customizations and considerations:\n",
      "- You can add checks to ensure that the input is indeed a vector (or a 1-dimensional array) to handle potential errors gracefully.\n",
      "- The function, as written, uses NumPy, which is efficient for array operations. If you're not working with large datasets, you might replace NumPy with basic Python lists for simplicity.\n",
      "- In deep learning applications, softmax is often used after the last hidden layer of a neural network, to obtain a probability distribution over the classes.\n",
      "- While softmax is useful for multiclass classification, it might not be suitable for problems with a large number of classes. This is because the probability of each class decreases inversely proportional to the number of classes, making the problem sensitive to outliers.\n",
      "- During the computation of softmax, very large values in the input vector can cause numerical instability. The normalization step helps mitigate this issue, but extremely large values might still cause problems.\u001b[0m\n",
